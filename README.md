# US Housing Analysis 2010 to 2019
<br>
Housing Info App - This housing app is intended for scholastic research and not for someone in the market for house hunting. There are some key factors that are noticeable starting with occupancy rate.
<br>
The occupancy tends to condense in coastal areas in the main land except northern and southern caps. On contrary to popular belief high occupancy is not the biggest factor for house value. For house median value, the state of Hawaii has maintained as it top most rank in the last decade. Colorado state jumped in rank and Washington DC median value increased by $200K in the last decade. SMOCAPI: Most states have a fairly small portion of population under cost burdens, however, destination states like California and Hawaii have more people paying dangerously high amounts to maintain their houses. Hawaii is using ten time more solar energy than any other state. Maine's two-third of fuel consumption comes from the fuel-oil for heating households.
